    "bio":"I love to code. I have built a handful of projects using HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Boostrap, PHP and MySQL. The stack I currently am enjoying the most is using React, Node.js and either NoSQL database langauges like MongoDB and Firebase or an RDBMS like PostgreSQL and MySQL. I'm also an avid woodworker! I stumbled into a passion for woodworking when my neighbors were throwing out a pottery barn dining table and asked if I wanted it. Having zero clue what I was doing, I refinished the table and have not been able to stop restoring and building furniture since. I love the craft of building something tangible and figuring out the best way to build something - quite similar to how I feel about coding!",
